<p>The Lion is a large cat native to the Americas. 
The lion is mostly called the king of the jungle because of their raw power and strength. Lions fear no other animals, however 
like a king lions do have enemies.<br/> The Lions worst enemy is the Hyna. Hynas eat the same food as lions, so the lions and the hyenas often come into conflict.
